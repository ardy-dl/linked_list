# Merge Linked List
###### Lab Problem: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists   

## How it works?
- thru instantiating an object and calling the methods directly from the code at the bottom part.
- The program merges 2 linked lists into 1 and displaying it into a sorted linked list.
## How to use?
1. Open the program merged_Linklist.py
2. Methods:
     append() = adds a data to the node
     search() = finds the entered data and returns True or False
     merge() = merges your chosen linked list but can only combine 2 linked list as of the moment
     printLinkedList() = displays the linked list
3. Instantiate an object at the bottom part of the code by using the methods above.
